# squareroot.py
# This takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
# create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
# create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
# look at the newton method at estimating square roots.
